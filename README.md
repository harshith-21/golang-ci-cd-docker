# Golang + ci cd + docker

> As the title suggests, its a project to automate docker based deployments using jenkins

## **SETUP**

### Jenkins setup

I am using a RHEL8 machine, so the commands and setup will be done for that, you will find alternatives for those pretty easily

To install jenkins
```sh
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
sudo yum upgrade

# Add required dependencies for the jenkins package
sudo yum install fontconfig java-17-openjdk
sudo yum install jenkins
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Start jenkins

sudo systemctl enable jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl status jenkins
```

> You will get a temporary password at `/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword` use that to login at `http://{{your_host_ip}}:8080` and then create appropriate user with password.

Then you can install community suggested plugins and then you will a dashboard page for jenkins

### Repo setup

Create a github repo, preferably a public one :) 

Now we will add that Jenkinsfile in that repo with a content for a simple pipeline. you can use content of jenkinsfile_init. Push that to repo.


### Configure jenkins to this repo

Select new Item in jenkins dashboard, give and name and select pipeline and hit ok

In that scroll to pipeline and select `Pipeline script from SCM`, select GIT as SCM as follows

Now set repo url, credentials if private :)

Dont forget to change branch as applicable for your repo.

Once you hit save, you will be able to run pipeline, and you will be able to see following if you hit the job that has been run

sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/rhel/docker-ce.repo
sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
sudo systemctl start docker
